Put **autoexec.cfg** (Right click and Save as on file above) into **%UserProfile%\Documents\My Games\Tabletop Simulator** (Paste this into address bar in File Explorer)

This will set up keys:
* Keypad 1-6 for views 1-6
* F11 To turn on/off window in window view (as shown below)
* F12 To turn on second monitor view (off doesn't work currently)
  

To set views 1 to 6 put your main view in the desired location using movement keys etc then press ctrl+1, 2 etc.
